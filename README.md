# Secure Cloud-Based File Storage Platform

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating a secure cloud-based file storage platform that ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of digital data. The system protects sensitive user information on cloud servers by combining robust **encryption protocols** and **access control mechanisms**. Users can securely store, upload, and share files without worrying about unauthorized access or data alteration. 

The proposed system increases trust in cloud computing services by allowing users to fully manage their data security, with **client-side encryption and decryption**, and a privacy-oriented cloud architecture.

## Objectives

To achieve the project goal, the following specific objectives have been defined:

- **Implement high-end encryption algorithms:**  
  Use **AES** for file encryption and **RSA** for secure key exchange to make files inaccessible to unauthorized users.

- **Ensure data integrity:**  
  Use **SHA-256 hashing** and digital signatures to detect any alteration or manipulation of stored data.

- **Provide secure authentication and access control:**  
  Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to grant users access based on their roles.

- **Create a user-friendly interface:**  
  Design an intuitive interface that allows users to **upload, download, and share files** without technical expertise.

- **Ensure data availability:**  
  Implement system redundancy and **automated database backups** to prevent data loss even if the system becomes temporarily unavailable.

- **Test and verify system performance:**  
  Evaluate the **security, reliability, and effectiveness** of encryption, access control, and user interface.
